Recency of Access
Last Access Time: The exact timestamp of when the cache item was last accessed. Items not accessed for a long time might be candidates for eviction.
Access Pattern
Access Frequency Over Time: Track how access frequency changes over time. If an itemâ€™s access frequency is declining, it might be less valuable.
Burstiness: Items that are accessed in bursts but have long periods of inactivity might need different eviction strategies.
Cache Item Size
Storage Cost: Large items might be evicted more readily if storage space is limited, especially if they provide less value compared to their size.
Content Type
Type of Content: Different content types (e.g., static images, dynamic content, database queries) may have different relevance and access patterns, influencing eviction decisions.
Staleness
Data Freshness: In cases where data freshness is critical, older items that may become stale could be prioritized for eviction.
